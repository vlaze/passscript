# passscript

My first script, no Hello Worlds for today.

Last weekend my teacher installed a VNC server client (Epoptes) in my classroom computers. Feeling challenged, I wanted to try how 'strong' was the system, and after some minutes I managed to get rid of my teacher's control just by killing the process.

I went home, and I decided to improve the server security just by configurating a few options via a simple bash script, my very first script. This was the idea that brang PassScript to life.
